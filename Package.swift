        // If you're getting the error 'does not contain expected binary artifact',
        // then the filename of the xcframework doesn't match the name module that's
        // exposed within it.
        // There's a *tight* coupling to the module name (case sensitive!!) and the
        // name of the XCFramework. Annoying, yeah - but there it is.

        // In addition to the name of the framework, the binary target name in
        // Package.swift MUST be the same as the exported module. Without it, you'll
        // get the same error. And there's some detail that if you use a compressed,
        // remote framework and forgot to compress it using ditto with the option
        // '--keepParent', then it'll expand into a different name, and again
        // - wham - the same "does not contain the expected binary" error.
